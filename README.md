# extended_caesar_cipher
An extended version of the classic Caesar cipher encryption technique

This encryption source code is based on the so-called 'Caesar cipher' technique wherein each letter of the plaintext is assigned to another letter of the alphabet based on a shift number. In this extended version it is not the alphabet that decides the shift number, but the occurrence of a letter in a text that functions as a secret key.

This project was purely intended for 'fun' purposes. Perfect results in both encryption as well as decryption are not guaranteed. The source code works best with text (.txt) files that contain actual text (and not for example, numbers).

In this repository are two Python files with source code. One for encryption and another for decryption of files originating out of the encryption. You will need a plaintext file (.txt) with a secret key. In the example I have worked with an extract of Caesar's 'De Bello Gallico' as secret key just as a pun to the name of the encryption algorithm, but any text will do.
